	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Test against your own audience, but I would bet heavily against the conclusion "Usage limited trials outperform free trials" for the majority of SaaS apps.  Dropbox's case is different with a capital D because the trial/invite mechanic is code to their viral adoption.<p>One powerful reason why you generally want to avoid having a meter running is you are really making two related but distinct sales: you are trying to convince them to pay, yes, but you are also trying to convince them to use your thing versus their existing way of doing business.  That is often the harder sale.  Putting a marginal cost, even in free quota, for using your thing puts friction in the adoption process, which you KEENLY do not want.</p>
<p>While it may be the case as a bootstrapped entrepreneur that your business has not yet spent the sum of $600 on everything put together, the overwhelming majority of businesses are not like you.  Many businesses will spend $600 <i>today</i> on one line item, for instance virtually any company which employs 3 or more college graduates.  Many of these businesses also have habits with regards to buying software which are more beneficial to SaaS companies than your habits are, for example a) having predictable positive ROI on integration costs and b) never attempting to optimize for $150 expenses by switching providers on a whim.</p></font></span>

Given what I currently surmise about the per-account LTVs for higher-end customers of Appointment Reminder, at many plausible guesses for how many conversations I can have per day and how many people I can convert, it might be worth my time to do that.

Think of any phone call, incoming or outgoing, which is sufficiently standardized that you could teach any college graduate to execute that.  That person can be replaced with a Twilio script, at a fraction of the cost.</p>
<p>My wife is sleeping in the room with my business notebooks so I'll hold off on finding and scanning it for the moment, but it was literally as simple as a) write down business, b) write down the calls they make, c) star the ones that sound like <i>money</i>.</p>
<p><i>I think bitcoin might be another technology that makes big "ripples", no?</i></p>
<p>We will have to agree to disagree on that one.  Bitcoin's core innovation is the distributed self-organizing boiler room.  As a transaction processing system it's technically innovative but wildly inferior to legacy payments for transactions which need to touch the real world.  (It's interesting for transactions which don't, but could be replaced with a SQL update statement, which would improve upon it in virtually every way.)  As a currency/commodity, the arguments in favor of it having a sustainable value north of zero are not credible to me.  The main reason I have not nailed an 8,000 word stake in its rotten heart is that I think there's a non-zero risk that people will use every additional quantum of attention given to it as a reason to convince other people to "invest."</p></font></span>

	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000">In answer to the general query for advice:<p>Short version: program things which make your employers lots of money, and get in the habit of mentioning that repeatedly when you negotiate aggressively for more compensation.  Long version: <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-pro...</a></p>
<p>A personal anecdote: In 2006 I wrote CRUD apps, talked to people, and read a lot of documents.  In 2013 I will write CRUD apps, talk to people, and read a lot of documents.  I'll also get paid probably in excess of 10X what I made in 2006.  To the extent that the difference involves programming, it's largely not because I've suddenly graduated to Guru Rockstar Ninja and more because I figured out how to apply programming to a few of capitalism's pressure points.  (Mostly involving selling more software.)  This turns out to be fantastically more valuable than writing CRUD apps to e.g. manage student lists for university back offices.  This difference is a <i>lot</i> more important than other competing explanations like where I live, what industry I work in, or the fact that I changed from J2EE to (mostly) Ruby on Rails in the interim.</p>
<p>There are many HNers whose programming skill is a key asset to their line of work and yet would not be classified as programmers, by the way.  I encourage you to not see their jobs as out-of-scope if your goals are making a lot of money while continuing to program.  That's quite a bit of the solution set.  (Then again, AmaGooBookSoft have many, many uncomplicated "We give you instructions, you producing working code implementing them" jobs which would meet your requirements.)</p></font></span>

<p>2. Whether you want to admit it or not, <i>everyone</i> answers to <i>someone</i>.</p>
<p>3. Make no mistake about it: if you build anything, you benefit, often more than those you built it for. In fact, to become an excellent programmer, there is no better way. It doesn't matter <i>who</i> you built it for, it just matters <i>that</i> you built it.</p>
<p>4. Literal definition of "professional": earns money. There's probably no better way to be a professional programmer than to build corporate CRUD apps. Looser definition of "professional": someone I would want to march into digital battle with. I would most certainly pick someone who has written many corporate CRUD apps over someone who has recently embraced some sexy new technology from the conference and community du jour.</p></font></span>

That's right, everything I wrote in 1985 would compile and run perfectly in the environment I'm connected to in my other session right now. And everything I'm writing today would have also worked on that mini-computer back then. I wonder how many other programmers could make the same claim.<p>I have learned and continue to use many other client/server and web-based technologies since then but somehow, I always come back to "old faithful".</p></font></span>

<p>What's a "binary roadblock"? Something that, when it doesn't run fast, no amount of "tuning" could fix it. You better be obsessing over things like these or you'll be dead in the water as soon as that nasty roadblock manifests itself. Some examples:</p>
<p></p>
<pre><code>  - 2 proven technologies whose combination is not proven
  - bad database structure that doesn't hurt until a query you never planned for
  - bad program structure whose memory leaks don't show without an outlying case
  - lazy code that blows up as soon as programmer #2 "enhances" it
  - shit that works by accident until it doesn't work anymore
  - sleepers than appear to run well until you try to scale
  - structures aimed at incorrect user assumptions

Speed to market is important. Careful thought into what can easily become a roadblock is just as important.</font></span>

	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Although this is an extreme example, I sympathize and often have feelings like this. But it's not about the amount of work; it's about the constant internal struggle. Let me explain.<p>I have <i>never</i> had a problem about the volume or difficulty of work in any job I've ever had. In fact, some of my favorite memories of work have been sprints to finish something, whether in software, retail/distribution, or food service. I take great pride in <i>delivering</i>, sometimes with compromised quality, but always on time and budget. I imagine many here feel the same way.</p>
<p>My internal struggle is the constant questioning of <i>whether or not I should even put up with illogical bullshit</i>. I have no doubt that hard work, long hours, complex work, and difficult customers are occasionally part of my world. But every day, in my morning exercise when I would prefer focusing on the work of the day, I always find my mind drifting into anger over unnecessary bullshit like:</p>
<p></p>
<pre><code>  - working for unethical people
  - watching others line their pockets while I work
  - choosing what's best for the company vs. the customer
  - busting my ass while others sit and watch
  - endless meetings about nothing
  - watching great stuff I built being scrapped by idiots
  - watching horrible decisions made by those for their own benefit
  - witnessing the functional taking back seat to the political
  - dealing with managers who don't understand technology (and don't care to learn)
  - dealing with people who don't understand the business/industry and (don't care to learn)
  - horrible working conditions for workers while managers get luxury
  - constant work-prevention structure imposed by people who have never accomplished anything
</code></pre>
Some days I'm on top of the world, rejoicing when something I built provides great value to others. Other days, I feel like I'm digging holes on the beach only to see them filled up by the overnight tide of idiotic others.<p>My struggle continues. I only hope I have the foresight to take intervention before I ever become like OP.</p></font></span>

<p>PaulHoule, nice story, but what's the point?</p>
<p>larrys, My list does not directly contradict the success of just about all luxury brands that have been successful. They would probably agree. They've just chosen to thrive in such an environment. I don't.</p>
<p>Samuel_Michon. I believe you. Thanks for sharing your experience.</p>
<p>fredsted, it pretty much does not differ from everybody else? I'd rather have 100 difficult customers with 1% of my ass than 1 difficult customer with 100% of my ass. That's all.</p>

	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000"><i>If you are an entrepreneur starting a business, you should already know that the odds are against you. This is simply a statistical fact.</i><p>Then the best way to succeed is not to understand that the odds are against you, it's to change those odds. If investors won't invest, find out why and change those odds. If no one wants to join you, find out why and change those odds. If customers don't buy, find out why and change those odds. If things don't work, find out why and change those odds.</p>
<p><i>Not only that, but most successes rely on countless variables, and most of these variables are out of your control. </i></p>
<p>Then find a way to work in a world defined by less-than-countless variables, most of which <i>are</i> within your control. You can't control what others will think or do, but there are things you <i>can</i> determine that will affect you plan of action.</p>
<p><i>By deduction, most successes are lucky ones.</i></p>
<p>Remove the words "By deduction" and your sentence is generally true. Keep those words and get a chuckle from those who know how to alter their landscape to remove luck from the equation.</p></font></span>

	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000"><i>...but we are moving more and more to a transparent society...</i><p>This key issue isn't whether or not things are changing (they are) or whether it's good or bad (that's debatable).</p>
<p>The key issue is <i>who gets to decide</i>.</p>
<p>If I want to tell the world a million things about myself, that's my business. But if someone else wants to tell the world things about me (especially if they know it's personal or private), then that's definitely not cool.</p>
<p>It's not that much different for institutions, companies, or any group in general. None of us should be surprised at the reaction of another whose digital cherry we popped on-line.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the old tale about the man with a gossiping problem who went to a sage for advice. The sage told him to slice open a feather-filled pillow, shake it outside his house, then come back tomorrow. The next day the man asked the sage what to do about his gossip problem. The sage said, "Go gather those feathers."</p></font></span>

	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000">patio11 and I had a great conversation about this a few months back: <a href="http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/10/10/kalzumeus-podcast-3-growing-consulting-practices-with-brennan-dunn/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/10/10/kalzumeus-podcast-3-grow...</a><p>But basically, here's the trick to close more deals and make more money: Become an investment, not an expense.</p>
<p>Spending money on technology (Rails, Wordpress) is an expense that implicitly doesn't correlate with any business "win". For most businesses, that win is making more money. However, when you get past the reason someone approaches you ("I need a website") to the core pain they're experiencing ("I need more customers!!!"), you can tailor everything '&#148; your proposal, meetings, execution, handoff '&#148; toward that end.</p>
<p>Instead of, "I will build your restaurant a website in Wordpress" '&#148;&Acirc;&nbsp;which doesn't answer the questions, "Will I make more money than I'm spending on this guy if I do this?"</p>
<p>Try, "I will tailor your website to get you more walk-in customers.", which conveys that you're going to be focused on getting them more business.</p>
<p>I've talked about this in length in my books, but I've also covered this on my podcast, most notably with the recent episode (#8): <a href="http://brennandunn.com/category/podcast/" rel="nofollow">http://brennandunn.com/category/podcast/</a></p></font></span>

	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000">Here's what I think is being missed in this discussion:<p>Product != Software</p>
<p>People buy software because they desire some intended outcome. For instance, I recently switched to Xero because emailing spreadsheets of categorizations back and forth to my accountant is messy and frustrating. And I might buy a book on bookkeeping because I suck at it. Or a course on cashflow because I never learned how to properly budget.</p>
<p>I think if you were to ask me, Patrick, Amy, Nathan, etc... if we see a huge difference between, say, a SaaS product we run and a workshop we teach, we wouldn't. The goal's the same: make someone better off than they were before.</p>
<p>It's really frustrating, but understandable on HN, to see people downplay products that aren't software. When writing Planscope, my goal was to help increase project transparency between consultants and their clients. After talking with many customres, I realized a large number of them needed help on something much more foundational to their business: how to price. So I built another product that helped people with that.</p>
<p>(Also, I honestly don't think that posting some '&#148; hopefully helpful '&#148; content on what I learned in trying to sell a book is going to result in "Double UR Freelancing Ratez" coming out and crushing my sales anytime soon.)</p></font></span>

	<div class="comment">
	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000">This.<p>It might sound strange, but most service providers are "selfish" in their pricing. Meaning, a rate is determined by looking <i>inward</i> '&#148;&Acirc;&nbsp;how much do I need to charge to make more than my monthly fixed expenses? What's the equivalent hourly rate when I was a salaried employee? What are my peers charging?</p>
<p>I've been able to continuously raise my rates over the years ($50 -&gt; $250+/hr) by getting better at understanding the business problem at the root of a project request (i.e. they don't "want a new website designed", they really just want more walk-in customers) and tailoring my proposal, discussions, and execution toward that end.</p>
<p>As long as you can position yourself as an investment instead of an expense, and wield your technical + business skills to make your client's business better off than they were before hiring you, your ceiling is whenever the project cost outweighs the potential payoff.</p>

	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000">You know what I find tiresome'&brvbar; pink, Audrey Hepburn, shoes. These are the things other "women in tech" assume I am interested in.<p>I like GitHub and believe it's full of good people. But when they invited me to speak as part of their Passion Project, the invitation package included a hoodie with a pink octocat logo on it, and stickers: Audrey Hepburn octocat wearing pearls, and some other girlie octocat I didn't recognize. Now there's a culture I am turned off by.</p>
<p>Fact: Everybody discriminates against everybody, all the time. Assuming women hate whatever "male-dominated culture" means is just as bad as assuming they like Breakfast at Tiffany's.</p>
<p>To be good at programming (not even great), you need to love it, and to love it requires a special kind of perversity. Your "hundreds of women who could make it" -- do they have that special kind of perversity?</p>
<p>Actually building software is an epic and enormous pain in the ass. You have to love controlling, beating and dominating the computer. Otherwise you'll come to a point where it simply won't be worth the time and aggravation to proceed.</p>
<p>Probably the best way to attract a more diverse set of programmers is to change what programming means, not try to reform the Trekkies who were drawn to the way programming currently <i>is</i>. (Or the women who assume woman programming = wants pink hoodies.) It is the mold that shapes the pot, not the other way around.</p></font></span>

If you doubt you won on merit, you need to decide whether <i>you</i> would have granted yourself the prize, all things being equal. If you are unable to accurately assess your work, you'll always be at the whims of other people's opinions. On the other hand, know your own worth -- even if it means admitting to yourself "this was a gimme, I need more work" -- and you will always be the one in power of your destiny. Which will put you way, way, ahead of just about every other person, including 99% of men.<p>Aside from that, this is why contests are stupid. And most things in life are contests. What's great about selling products, instead of being employed or consulting, is that you win if you solve the customer's problems, not if they think they should give you a break.</p></font></span>

    </span>
	<div class="comment">
	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000">The people in the know now understand that what we call "burnout" is not a psychological disorder at all, but sub-clinical[1] adrenal fatigue caused by stress, period. In other countries with superior medical system integration, like Austria/Germany, this is an accepted medical fact.<p>If you stress out a rat long enough, its adrenal glands will actually bleed. If you stress out a human long enough, you cause first a huge ongoing spike in cortisol etc., and later, a serious drop as the damage is done. This can be measured easily using a 24-hour cortisol saliva or blood test, but it rarely is. (Related hormones: DHEA, thyroid).</p>
<p>Symptoms of burnout are just like the symptoms of CFS/low thyroid because they are part of the HPA (Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenals) Axis. They're tightly coupled.</p>
<p>While short bursts of endorphins will make you feel better, the effect will be temporary. Endorphins will not make your adrenal glands or thyroid work again. Instead, they mask the symptoms'&brvbar; but only for a while. There are only three ways to get better: Dramatically cut stress. Wait. Take medication. Pick 2.</p>
<p>[1] "Sub-clinical" usually means "not measurable," but in the case of "burnout" and adrenal fatigue, it is absolutely measurable. However, I call it sub-clinical because of the way most doctors think of the adrenal glands. Most doctors believe that the adrenal glands are binary: they are either working perfectly, or totally non-functional (Addison's disease). Unless you're on the verge of death from lack of cortisol, they will tell you you're fine.</p>
<p>If you have burnout, get your 24-hour saliva test. Take your morning temperature with an old-fashioned thermometer under your arm for 10 min. Look up the other symptoms of adrenal fatigue and hypothyroid. There's plenty of research published about how burnout is measurable and related to the HPA axis -- you don't have to take my word for it. There are lots of support groups, too, where the sufferers have often presaged the research.</p>
<p>And for god's sake, stop telling yourself it's about failure or investment or whatever and <i>stop stressing yourself out, period</i>, or you can get like I am and it can become <i>permanent</i>.</p>
<p>EDIT: If you google "burnout syndrome" you will read several sources claiming that there is no proof it's a real thing. This is 100% false. They also say it's not accepted by the medical community, but rather a quacky way to sell supplements. It's true that most doctors are unaware of the research, but the ones who do treat it with real medicine (see below).</p>
<p>It's painfully easy to say "There's no proof" but a 5-minute search of Google Scholar shows otherwise:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/61/2/197.short" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/content/61/2/197.short</a> (from 1999!)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399999000070" rel="nofollow">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022399999...</a></p>

<p><a href="http://gimle.fsm.it/28/1s_psi/05.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://gimle.fsm.it/28/1s_psi/05.pdf</a></p>
<p>The theories from doctors who've spent their lifetime researching it go as follows: Burnout happens in stages. In the early stages, cortisol etc. are elevated. In the later stages, the "fatigue" sets in, and cortisol is too low. I personally spent 3+ months in low-cortisol hell and it was the most awful time in my life'&brvbar; and there have been some really bad times in my life. .</p>
<p>And there are quite a lot of endocrinologists etc. who will treat low-testing cortisol patients with hydrocortisone, isocort or florinef or other <i>drugs</i> which are not "supplements" by any stretch of the imagination.</p>
<p>IF you are stressing yourself out, and IF you keep going down that road, this is what you have to look forward to:</p>
<p>Being unable to get out of bed. Being unable to make the simplest of decisions without feeling like you're having a panic attack. Being unable to read, because it's too much information at once. Being unable to watch TV shows that have too many "facts" in them. All of the above -- including simple questions of "What do you want for lunch, honey?" -- triggered panic-like attacks in me, who'd never had a panic attack despite years of physical and emotional abuse as a child. It was like being surrounded and squeezed and shouted at by a million people all at once, just to try to <i>listen to my lunch options</i>. That is because cortisol is required to rise to the "stress" of every day living'&brvbar; standing up from sitting is a stress, making decisions, etc., all create tiny spikes of cortisol to help you cope. If your cortisol is too low, you are screwed.</p>
<p>Is there any "victory" worth a life like that? Can you even call that a life?</p></font></span>

	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000">I've been watching these issues for a long time and here's the conclusion I've come to:<p>Americans care far more about people getting "what they deserve," than caring about costs in the long run. Many of the Americans who have the least will still argue against <i>people like them</i> getting "free" things like healthcare -- "I DON'T HAVE HEALTHCARE, LOOK AT ME, I'M FINE". Because they believe those other people don't <i>deserve</i> it. On some level, they believe <i>they</i> don't <i>deserve</i> it either. <i>(In America, land of opportunity, you get what you deserve! So if you don't have it already, you don't deserve it, post ergo propter hoc.)</i></p>
<p>This also explains why allegedly fiscally conservative Republicans don't support a guaranteed minimum income, because "those people" haven't "earned" it -- no matter that the uncountable costs to society, and the totally countable costs to the government/taxation system, is much greater when people go poor and raise their children in poverty and in slums.</p>
<p>Americans, by and large, are so afraid that one person will get something they don't "deserve" that they'd rather punish them, and everyone else, many times over. The opposite of "Better 10 guilty men go free, than one innocent suffer."</p>
<p>IMO this also explains our ridiculously punitive sentences, instead of simple rehabilitation which is proven to reduce recidivism. "Why would you give them THERAPY? and GYMS? and let them have PUPPIES? THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE IN JAIL!" And why so much (much more than you'd think) of the general spirit seems to be against young women who are raped. And on and on. People obviously must be getting what they deserve, or nothing makes sense about their beliefs about themselves, their country, what they've achieved (or not) in their lives, etc.</p>
<p>(I say "Americans" because I've lived for years in another country and traveled all over, and this is far from a universal feeling.)</p>
<p>Puritannical background at work? Perhaps. Certainly not Quaker.</p></font></span>

	  <span class="comment"><font color="#000000">&gt; and yet no one uses that a reason to make trite remarks about how we can't possibly allow a free market in food<p>We do not have a free market in food. Even if you ignore subsidies entirely'&brvbar; Have you not heard of the FDA? Upton Sinclair? Health inspections for restaurants? Requirements to enrich certain food products, pasteurize others?</p>
<p>How about the pet food and baby formula from China (free market!) that was found to have melamine and other poisons in it?</p>
<p>A free market in food results in low quality, unsafe, non-nutritious food. Or things that masquerade as food but aren't. 
On that note'&brvbar; History will look back at many of our legal "foodstuffs" of today and call them as awful as Radon Water:</p>

<p>Like slums (see my other comment) -- people will pay to live in slums, you know, the free market creates them --- a free market for food provides for a few and poisons the rest. Not unlike the healthcare situation in the US.</p></font></span>

I'd need to split hairs to determine what time was spent where and in the end I just needed to write.</p>
<p>It's the same problem with choosing a ebook platform. No tool does you any good until you are actually using it. I'm currently writing in Apple's Pages app because it was the nearest and easiest way to just get started.</p>

In this case, I'm quite impressed you got over 500 visitors that way too, as I only gave it a minor feature right in the middle of the newsletter (things like this perform and convert a lot better when featured at the top of the mail).<p>In my experience, conversions go through the roof when the editorial mention includes a recommendation. I hadn't seen the book, so I could only give it a casual mention. If you reach out further in advance and allow people to review it, you can get better mentions, not just in newsletters but on people's blogs and sites like RubyFlow, etc. This will increase conversions a lot.</p>
<p>When you finish the book, definitely hit me up. Assuming it's of the right quality, I think even more people will be more interested and I should be able to mention it again.</p></font></span>
